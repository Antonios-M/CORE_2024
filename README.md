## Project Overview

CORE 2024 is a project focused on designing a system of multi-robot assembly of rigidity-preserving structures, all while elminating the use of scaffolding

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the project
- `examples/`: Example files for assembly sequence and robot prototype
- `data/`: Datasets of cutting patterns and structural design
- `gh/`: Grasshopper files for robot protype and structural design / assembly sequence
